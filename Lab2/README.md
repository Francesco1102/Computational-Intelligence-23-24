# Lab 2: ES

## Task

Write agents able to play [*Nim*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim), with an arbitrary number of rows and an upper bound $k$ on the number of objects that can be removed in a turn (a.k.a., *subtraction game*).

The goal of the game is to **avoid** taking the last object.

* Task2.1: An agent using fixed rules based on *nim-sum* (i.e., an *expert system*)
* Task2.2: An agent using evolved rules using ES

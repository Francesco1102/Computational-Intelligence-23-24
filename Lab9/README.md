# LAB 9

Write a local-search algorithm (eg. an EA) able to solve the *Problem* instances 1, 2, 5, and 10 on a 1000-loci genomes, using a minimum number of fitness calls. That's all.

## Notes
I try different approach (steady state, generational + elitism, promoting diversity in particularly with segregation, different crossover and different mutation) and for each *Problem* instances I show the best approach for me.

### *Problem* instances 1
best approach: 
- generational + elitism
- uniform crossover
- mutation = one bit flip
### *Problem* instances 2
best approach: 
- generational + elitism (+ segregation)
- uniform crossover
- mutation = one bit flip
### *Problem* instances 5
best approach: 
- generational + elitism (+ segregation)
- uniform crossover
- mutation = N bit flip
### *Problem* instances 10
best approach: 
- generational + elitism (+ segregation)
- uniform crossover
- mutation = one bit flip
